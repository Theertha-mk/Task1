         <p style="color: cornsilk; line-height: 1.6;">Indra Nooyi is an Indian-American businesswoman, best known as the former chief executive officer of the PepsiCo company. She has repeatedly appeared in lists of the most powerful and wealthy women in the world, well-known for her dedication to healthy products and equality in the workplace, as well as her keen strategic mind and bold decision-making.<br>
          Many years before becoming PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi studied in her homeland of India. She attended Madras Christian College at the University of Madras. There, she specialized in science, receiving multiple bachelor's degrees in the fields of mathematics, chemistry, and physics in 1974.

          She then proceeded to the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta to hone her business skills with a post-graduate diploma. In 1978, she began to study at Yale University in the USA, working towards a Master's degree in Public and Private Management, which she attained in 1980.<br>
          Indra Nooyi's success began in her academic studies, and her impressive qualifications helped her obtain a job as a product manager in India with Johnson & Johnson. She also spent time working at the textile company, Mettur Beardsell.

          After moving to the US, she attended an internship at Booz Allen Hamilton and later worked as a strategy consultant with the Boston Consulting Group. She quickly worked her way up the ranks of the professional world, later obtaining a Vice President role at Motorola and spending some time at the technology firm, ASEA Brown Boveri.<br>
          In 1994 Indra Nooyi joined PepsiCo. She started off as the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and held this position for two years, working her way up to the role of Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Development, and then the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Eventually, she became President and Chief Financial Officer, and she achieved all of this in her first seven years with the company.

          One of the big reasons why Nooyi was such a success at PepsiCo and was able to rise through the ranks so quickly was through her shrewd strategic moves that paid big dividends for the company. Just a year after joining PepsiCo, she oversaw the company's restructuring, including the divestiture of Tricon, which would later become Yum! Brands. Nooyi was also put in charge of the company's acquisition of Tropicana in the late 90s, along with other major deals like the Quaker Oats merger.

          Some of Nooyi’s decisions were criticized at first, but later proved highly beneficial for the brand, and PepsiCo's annual net profits more than doubled within the first couple of years of Nooyi's work. Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo CEO, was quickly recognized as a force to be reckoned with, and upon becoming the CEO of the company, she became known as one of the most powerful and influential women in the business world.

          In 2018, Nooyi announced that she was stepping down from the CEO position. She was replaced by Ramon Laguarta, who had been with the company for more than 20 years. Over the course of her time in the position, Nooyi helped the company's sales improve by 80%, and she decided that the time was right to take a break before moving on to new projects, hoping to help women get more leadership positions and promote equality in the workplace, as well as pursuing endeavors with non-profit organizations in her home state of Connecticut.
